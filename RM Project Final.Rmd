### These files were placed in my Git Hub repo solely to allow my peer assessors to verify that the report was authored in R Markdown and compiled to pdf using pdflatex (via knitr), as part of the Regression Models course.  

### In accordance the Coursera Honor Code, I should not make such documents publicly available.  Iam therefore obliged to remove them, now that the assessment period is over.

### Thank you!
